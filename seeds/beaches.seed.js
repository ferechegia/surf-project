    { spotId: '584204204e65fad6a7709472', spotName: 'PANTIN ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ', spotDescription:'in Galicia is an exposed beach break that is often working and works all around the year. Offshore winds blow from the southeast with some shelter here from northeast winds. Most of the surf here comes from groundswells and the ideal swell direction is from the northwest. The beach break offers both left and right hand waves. Best around low tide. Often Crowded. Overcrowding can even make surfing hazardous.', },
    { spotId: '5842041f4e65fad6a7708c88', spotName: 'MUNDAKA', spotDescription:'The combination of river and oceanic currents have sculpted a sandbank of almost mathematical perfection to produce one of the most awesome waves on the planet. Access is simple enough, a gentle paddle from the harbor, but this isnt an easy wave to surf. The water detonates onto the shallow sand bank in a steep and pitching lunge, and although it is sand-bottomed, from here on in it breaks like a reef. Those who hit the bottom do so hard. The outer peak is dominated by a pack, but even the scraps way down the line can offer great barrels. Mundakas fantastically shaped rivermouth sandbar creates solid, 200-yard-long, top-to-bottom barrels.', },

    { spotId: '5842041f4e65fad6a7708be5', spotName: 'SNAPPER ROCKS', spotDescription:'on the Gold Coast is a fairly exposed point break that has very consistent surf.

    { spotId: '5842041f4e65fad6a7708d30', spotName: 'G- LAND', spotDescription:'in East Java is an exposed reef break that has very consistent waves.

    { spotId: '584204214e65fad6a7709c91', spotName: 'PIPELINE', spotDescription:'Backdoor was somewhat ignored during Pipelines first golden days in the 1970s. It makes you wonder how many heaving barrels roared right off the peak before everyone kind of clicked on it. The wave relies on a slight breaking up of swell lines from the northwest (shorter to mid period swells are best, of a swell combo) and a thin channel between the Pipe reef and Off-The-Wall.', },
